# Global Fishing Watch Marine Manager: Tristan da Cunha

 The archipelago of Tristan da Cunha, in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, is home to the world’s most remote community and a rich diversity of marine species. In November 2020, the government of Tristan da Cunha announced the establishment of a marine protection zone (MPZ), excluding fishing activity from 90 percent of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and creating the largest fully protected MPZ in the Atlantic.

Management of the MPZ is not without challenges. Trans-Atlantic shipping lanes pass through Tristan’s EEZ, and while fishing vessels are now excluded from the MPZ, high densities of longline vessels fish in adjacent waters. Global Fishing Watch Marine Manager is a dynamic technology portal designed to make actionable information on human activity and environmental data available to managers of marine protected areas. In this report we aimed to demonstrate the utility of the marine manager portal by applying Global Fishing Watch data to three management use-cases for Tristan da Cunha.

This github repository includes all annotated code used to generate the tables and figures included in the report. The repository is organised as follows:

* analysis: annotated Rmarkdown notebooks which were used to create all R-generated figures and tables in the report.
* data: locally available sources of the data used in the report.
* queries: BigQuery queries, saved as .sql files, used to generate the data used in the report.
